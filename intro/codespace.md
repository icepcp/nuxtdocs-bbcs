# What is a Codespace?
A codespace is a cloud-based development environment provided by GitHub that allows you to code on any device even without VS code installed! It features a pre-configured environment with npm, yarn, etc installed, along with tight integration with GitHub so you are able to push your commits easily.

However, it is free only for 60 hours, so do be wary of your usage! (We are using 2-core machines with a limit of 120 single core hours)

Codespaces are also by default retained for only 30 days however you can change it to forever at https://github.com/codespaces
