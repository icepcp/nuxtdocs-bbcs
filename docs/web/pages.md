# Set up a page
Head to `app.vue` and change `<NuxtWelcome />` to
```vue
<NuxtPage />
```
Now, create a new directory by running this in the terminal
```bash
mkdir pages
```
You'll realise that a new folder has appeared in the file manager. Right click on it and press `Create Vue Page`. Name the page `index`.

Once you have created the file, expand the folder and open `index.vue`. You should see that there are some code elements placed for us. However, we won't be needing them.

Let's move on now to making a homepage.
