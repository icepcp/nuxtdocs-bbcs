# Commit and Sync changes
It's time to commit your work! Think about it like saving your work to somewhere, and everything you commit is tracked, so you can restore it back.
## Instructions
1. Open the **Source Control** tab on the left side

2. Give a message for your commit. I usually like to use the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), where it follows the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. I am going to name mines v1.0.0
3. Press `Commit` and `Always` if a dialog box appears
4. Press `Sync Changes`, and `OK` once again if a dialog box appears
