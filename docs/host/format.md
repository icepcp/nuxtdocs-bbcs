# Formatting your code
Before hosting, you should format your code so it is readable to you and others. 
## Instructions
Hit `Shift`+`Command`+`P` (Mac) / `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` (Windows/Linux) to open the Command Palette and type in `Format document` and select that option (not `Format document with`). Do this for every file in the `components` folder and `pages` folder. 

If you find the formatting to be off, like for example at the bottom it looks like this:
```vue
</div></template>
```
just run the command again
