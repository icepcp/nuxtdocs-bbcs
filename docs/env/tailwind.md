# Setting up TailwindCSS
1. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type in `nuxt css`
2. Select `Nuxtr: Configure CSS Frameworks`
3. Select `TailwindCSS` and tick **only the first two boxes**

Give it a while to install. Once it's done, a notification will pop out from the bottom right saying that TailwindCSS installed successfully along with two file created notifications. It is safe to close them all

If you do not see the option for `Nuxtr: Configure CSS Frameworks`, refresh the page. If you still don't see the option, make sure that you have [installed the Nuxtr extension.](/docs/env/nuxt.html#install-extensions)
