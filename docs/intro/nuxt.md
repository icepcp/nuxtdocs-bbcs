# What is Nuxt?
Nuxt.js is a web framework based on Vue.js. It is built on top of Vue.js and simplifies the development process along with better SEO, performance, and server-side rendering capabilities.
## Why Nuxt over Vue?
**Nuxt** if you want a framework that offers built-in modules and features with minimal configuration. If you prefer a more opinionated and guided development approach, suitable for both beginners and experienced developers, Nuxt is the way to go.

**Vue** if you are building a simple, client-side application without a need for server-side rendering. If you prefer more control over configuration and customization, Vue.js allows you to start from a clean slate and tailor the project to your exact needs.
